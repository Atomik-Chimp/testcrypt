# KandR

This is a Github project I'm using to learn C with the Kernighan and Ritchie book "The C Programming Language".  This will contain the code from the book directly, and hopefully solutions to all of the exercises eventually.

Thir Readme is also part of learning how to make a good Github repository.  It's taken from a template and will be edited during the project.

What I have learned to get projects up and started nicely with Github:

Step 1: Create the blank project on Github. I use the name of the directory for the project name.

Step 2: Create the local directory and clone the blank Github project to that directory.

Step 3: Create the Readme.md and .gitignore files in the directory. Then commit these new files to the project.

Step 4: I'm working in Visual C++ so I have .gitignored non-source Visual C++ files, I create the new Visual Studio Project, pointing to the directory above the Project folder.  That way Visual C++ doesn't create another folder of the same name inside my folder for it's files, it just uses my folder.

Step 5: Work on your project files and commit them to the project.  

I use Git Extensions to manage my Github files locally.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
