# testcrypt

This is to learn about basic encryption.

I'm also working on improving my readme and documentation skills.

What I have learned to get projects up and started nicely with Github:

Step 1: Create the blank project on Github. I use the name of the directory for the project name.
	1a: I didn't automatically make a readme or a .gitignore.

Step 2: Create the local directory and clone the blank Github project to that directory.
	2a: I'm working with gitextensions, when I define the location there it will make the base folder, so for example it will make the /testcrypt/ folder where every you set the location.

Step 3: Create the Readme.md and .gitignore files in the directory. Then commit these new files to the project.
	3a: I coppied these files from a previous project to the /testcrypt/ directory, then used the committ button in gitextensions.

Step 4: I'm working in Visual C++ so I have .gitignored non-source Visual C++ files, I create the new Visual Studio Project, pointing to the directory above the Project folder.  That way Visual C++ doesn't create another folder of the same name inside my folder for it's files, it just uses my folder.
	4a: I made the new project, and chose a console application and precompiled headers.

Step 5: Work on your project files and commit them to the project.  

I use Git Extensions to manage my Github files locally.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
